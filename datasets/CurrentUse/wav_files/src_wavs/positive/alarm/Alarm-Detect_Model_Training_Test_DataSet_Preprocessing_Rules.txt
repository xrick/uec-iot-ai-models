Alarm-Detect Model Training and Test DataSet Preprocessing Rules:
A. Rule-1:

1. Positive Alarm Data:
   training data:160
   validation data:40
   test:60(optional, depending on the project due time)

2. Negative Other-Sounds Data:
   training data:160, and including 20 types of demostic sounds.
   validation data:40 (2 sounds from the 20 types of demostic sounds)
   test:60(optional, depending on the project due time)

3. Siren-Sounds, clock-alarm, church_bells:
   neither positive data nor negative data include these three sounds.
   The reason is the three-sounds will cause ambiguous results in model training.
   But, there should be some way to dealing with problem, discussing with 
   Professor Chen.

 Rule-2:
 The 20 types of negative sounds are as following:
